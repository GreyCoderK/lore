# lore new

Create a documentation entry on demand.

## Synopsis

```
lore new [type] ["what"] ["why"] [flags]
```

## What Does This Do?

`lore new` creates a documentation entry **manually**, without waiting for a commit.

**Three ways to use it:**

| Mode | Command | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Interactive** | `lore new` | Most common — Lore asks you questions |
| **One-liner** | `lore new feature "add auth" "stateless scales"` | Quick capture when you know what to write |
| **Retroactive** | `lore new --commit abc1234` | Document a past commit you missed |

> **Analogy:** If the post-commit hook captures context in real time, `lore new` is the dedicated session where you document something you did earlier — or something that never produced a commit at all.

## Real World Scenario

> Morning standup. The team decided to migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. No code yet — just a decision. You want to capture it before the details fade:
>
> ```bash
> lore new decision "switch to PostgreSQL" "relational integrity for ACID transactions"
> ```
>
> Or later, you realize 3 commits from last week were never documented:
>
> ```bash
> git log --oneline -5
> lore new --commit abc1234
> ```

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `type` | No | Document type | `decision`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `note` |
| `what` | No | One-line summary (in quotes) | `"add JWT auth middleware"` |
| `why` | No | Rationale (in quotes) | `"stateless auth scales better"` |

If you don't provide arguments, Lore asks interactively.

## Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--commit <hash>` | string | — | Document a specific past commit |
| `--type <type>` | string | — | Pre-set the document type |

## Document Types Explained

| Type | Icon | When to use | Example |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| `decision` | 🏗️ | You chose between options | "Why PostgreSQL over MongoDB" |
| `feature` | ✨ | You built something new | "Add rate limiting middleware" |
| `bugfix` | 🐛 | You fixed a bug | "Fix race condition in token refresh" |
| `refactor` | ♻️ | You restructured code | "Extract auth into dedicated package" |
| `note` | 📝 | General knowledge | "Meeting notes: API versioning strategy" |

> **Tip:** Not sure which type? Ask yourself: "Am I choosing between options?" → `decision`. "Am I building something?" → `feature`. "Am I fixing something?" → `bugfix`. Still unsure? → `note`.

## The Question Flow

When you run `lore new` interactively, here's what happens:

![lore new interactive](../assets/vhs/interactive.gif)
<!-- Generate: vhs assets/vhs/interactive.tape -->

```
$ lore new

? Type: [Use arrows to select]
  > feature
    bugfix
    decision
    refactor
    note
    release
    summary

? What changed: Add JWT auth middleware
  (Pre-filled from context if available. Edit or press Enter.)

? Why was this done: Stateless authentication scales better than
  server-side sessions. We don't want to manage Redis for session state.

✓ Captured: decision-add-jwt-auth-middleware-2026-03-16.md
```

**For `decision` type**, you get 2 bonus questions:

```
? Alternatives considered: Session-based auth with Redis; OAuth2-only
? Impact: All API endpoints now require Bearer token
```

### Express Mode

If you answer all 3 main questions in under 3 seconds, Lore enters **express mode** and skips the bonus questions (Alternatives, Impact). This is for quick captures when you're in the flow.

## Examples

### Interactive (Most Common)

```bash
lore new
# → Asks Type, What, Why interactively
# → Creates .lore/docs/feature-add-auth-2026-03-16.md
```

### One-Liner (When You Know What to Write)

```bash
lore new decision "switch to PostgreSQL" "relational integrity for user accounts, ACID transactions needed"
# → Creates document immediately, no prompts
```

### Retroactive (Document a Past Commit)

```bash
# Find the commit you want to document
git log --oneline -5
# abc1234 feat: add rate limiting
# def5678 fix: token refresh bug

# Document it
lore new --commit abc1234
# → Pre-fills "What" from the commit message
# → You just need to add "Why"
```

### Pre-Set Type

```bash
lore new --type refactor
# → Skips the type selection, asks What and Why
```

## What Gets Created

A Markdown file in `.lore/docs/` with this structure:

```markdown
---
type: decision
date: 2026-03-16
status: draft
commit: abc1234567890abcdef
generated_by: manual
---
# Switch to PostgreSQL

## Why
Relational integrity for user accounts. We need ACID transactions
for the payment flow, and PostgreSQL's Go driver (pgx) is excellent.

## Alternatives Considered
- MongoDB: Flexible schema but we'd reimplement foreign keys in app code
- SQLite: Great for embedded use but not for multi-user API

## Impact
All persistence now goes through PostgreSQL. Migrations managed
with golang-migrate.
```

## Common Questions

### "What's the difference between `lore new` and the automatic hook?"

The **hook** fires automatically after every commit. Use `lore new` when you want to document something deliberately: a past commit, a decision made in a meeting, or a note not tied to any commit.

### "Can I edit a document after creating it?"

Yes! The documents are just Markdown files in `.lore/docs/`. Open them in any editor. Or use `lore angela polish` for AI-assisted editing.

### "What if I provide a wrong commit hash?"

```bash
lore new --commit nonexistent
# → Error: commit not found
# Lore validates the hash before proceeding.
```

## Tips & Tricks

- **One-liners for scripts:** `lore new feature "add auth" "stateless scales"` — no prompts.
- **After meetings:** `lore new decision` to capture decisions while the context is fresh.
- **Retroactive batch:** `git log --oneline -10` then `lore new --commit <hash>` for each.
- **Pre-set type:** `--type refactor` skips the selector when you already know.
- **Express mode:** Answer all 3 quickly (< 3 seconds) and Lore skips bonus questions.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Document created successfully |
| `1` | Error (commit not found, not in git repo) |
| `3` | Invalid arguments |
